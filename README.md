# JavaScript: Password Generator
 This homework assignment challenged myself to build an application that generated a password based on character criteria. 
 The application is powered by JavaScript and runs in the browser.
The user is given a series of prompts that set the values of the characters used when the "generate password," button is clicked.
The password can include numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters, and/or special characters. 
The password has to be between 8 and 128 characters long.
After the user picks their desired characters to be used in the password, the password is then generated and displayed in the "Your Secure Password" text area.
